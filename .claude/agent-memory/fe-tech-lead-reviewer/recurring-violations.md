Watch for these (each has bitten a story here):

- **Raw `text-white`/`bg-white` on edu-* surfaces** — engineers reach for `text-white` on
  `bg-edu-error`/`bg-edu-success` instead of the `*-foreground` token. Blocking. See [[conventions]].
  - **Special blocking case: `text-white` on `bg-edu-warning`** (`#ffae1f` yellow) ≈ 1.7:1 contrast —
    fails WCAG 1.4.3 AND the named rule in `accessibility.md` ("KHÔNG đặt text trắng trên --edu-warning
    → dùng --edu-warning-foreground" `#2A3547`). Watch for a single `text-white` shared across a
    button whose bg switches `conflictClass ? bg-edu-warning : bg-edu-primary` — the warning branch
    is the failure. (US-E12.4 add-student-panel transfer button.) Note `text-white` IS established
    precedent on `bg-edu-primary`/`bg-destructive` (shadcn button/badge, subject-catalogue) → only
    SHOULD-FIX there; warning-yellow is the hard gate.
- **Declared-but-unproduced failure types** — a `Failure` union member (e.g. `date-overlap`) with
  an i18n error key but NO use-case path that returns it = an unimplemented AC dressed up as done.
  Cross-check every AC validation rule against an actual `fail({type})` in a use-case.
- **Hardcoded Vietnamese in `.tsx`/actions** — mock-data nouns are fine, but UI-facing default
  strings (e.g. generated term name `Học kỳ N`) sent through the wire are borderline; flag if the
  string is user-visible copy rather than seed data.
- **`new Date()` in client handlers** for default values — non-deterministic; acceptable for a
  user-editable default but note it (the value becomes a real-clock dependency in any test).
- **Duplicate/placeholder i18n copy** — same message reused for two distinct slots (e.g. an info
  callout reusing `addYear.subtitle`) usually signals a missing dedicated key.
- **Dead i18n keys that PASS parity** — keys present in both vi+en (so the parity diff is clean) but
  never referenced in any `.tsx` (e.g. `table.loadMore`, `homeroomSheet.loading`, duplicate
  `actions.confirm`/`cancel` when the dialog uses scoped `archiveDialog.confirm`). Parity check alone
  won't catch them — grep each leaf key against presentation. Often signals a half-wired feature (a
  VM carrying `hasMore`/`nextCursor` with no load-more control rendered). SHOULD-FIX. (US-E12.10.)
- **One action bypassing its use-case** — when 3 of 4 server actions call `new XUseCase(repo).execute()`
  but one calls `repo.method()` directly (leaving the use-case as dead code). Pattern-inconsistency,
  not a correctness bug, but flag it — the bypassed use-case usually existed for a reason (validation
  that silently won't run). Cross-check every action wires through its use-case. (US-E12.10 archive.)
- **Bare `status === NNN` fallback in failure mapping** — `toFailure` branching `status === 422 →
  grade-out-of-range` after the code branch means ANY 422 (generic validation) gets mislabeled. Prefer
  letting non-matched codes fall through to `unknown`; status fallback should only cover transport
  categories (network/forbidden), not domain-specific 422/409. (US-E12.10.)

- **Repo methods implemented but never wired = dead AC** — a repo interface method (e.g.
  `listClasses`, `getClassSubjects`) implemented in BOTH real + mock repos but never exposed via a
  use-case/DI factory/action/page, while the screen instead uses a hardcoded `FALLBACK_*` /
  `MOCK_*_FOR_PICKER` const inside the `'use client'` file. Two violations at once: (a) the data-AC
  (picker fed by real list, availability filter) is unimplemented; (b) mock data lives in a
  production client code path (not a `*.mock.*`/server-only mock repo). tsc/tests stay green because
  the dead methods still type-check and the const renders. Cross-check: every repo interface method
  must trace to a consumer; grep `methodName` outside the repo impl/interface/test. (US-E13.5.)

- **Dead interactive button (no onClick)** — a per-row `<Button>` rendered with an `aria-label`
  + label but NO handler, when the real action lives elsewhere (e.g. discipline "Thông báo phụ huynh"
  per-row button while parent notification actually fires from the form's `notifyParent` toggle). A
  focusable control that does nothing = a11y/UX defect. SHOULD-FIX: wire it or remove it. Cross-check
  every `<Button>`/clickable for an `onClick`/`type=submit`/`asChild` link. (US-E09.1.)
- **`text-white` on `bg-edu-error` (count badge / chip)** — token violation; `--edu-error-foreground`
  (#fff) exists → fix `text-edu-error-foreground`. SHOULD-FIX when value is identical (coral, contrast
  fine); only the warning-yellow variant is a hard gate. (US-E09.1 tab count badge.)
- **`text-white` initials on a role/child-colored avatar circle where the color set INCLUDES
  `warning`** — e.g. `ChildColor = primary|success|warning|error|purple` with `text-white` on
  `backgroundColor: var(--edu-warning)`. Warning-yellow + white ≈ 1.7:1 fails the named a11y rule.
  Mitigant: if the initials are `aria-hidden` decorative AND the child name/class is shown as
  adjacent real text (so meaning isn't color/avatar-only), it's CONSIDER not blocking — but still
  flag, since the visible glyphs are sub-AA. (US-E13.7 ChildSwitcher avatar.)
- **New use-case + DI factory + endpoint added but zero callers (page wiring deferred)** — valid
  contract-first scaffolding ONLY when the story explicitly scopes out page sourcing (check the
  packet "Out of Scope"). Then it's a tracked follow-up, not dead code — but the AC are proven only
  at Storybook/VM level, NOT end-to-end. Verify the deferral is written in the packet before
  accepting; otherwise it's a half-wired feature. (US-E13.7: getChildList/makeGetChildListUseCase/
  GRADES_EP.childList unused; parent page + grade-book-container untouched — deferral is in spec.md.)

- **Read/query Server Actions missing `requireRole`** — engineers guard the mutations but leave
  the `get*`/`list*` actions unguarded, assuming the `/admin` layout role-guard covers them. It does
  NOT: Server Actions are independently invocable POST endpoints; the layout only guards RSC page
  render. Unguarded reads leak seal status, audit trails (who/when — Nghị định 13 sensitive), tenant
  admin rosters + student lists (PII) to any authenticated non-admin. EVERY new Server Action in a
  role-gated route needs its own `requireRole`. Blocking in high-risk lanes. (US-E14.6 actions.ts:
  6 read actions unguarded, only seal/initiate/confirm guarded.)
- **Two-person / co-sign gate bypassable via a "self-approve fallback" that isn't count-gated** —
  the fallback (single-admin tenant → self-approve) affordance is rendered/allowed whenever
  `isOwnRequest`, NOT gated on `tenantAdminCount === 1`, AND the use-case skips ALL checks when
  `coSignerId === null`. Result: in a multi-admin tenant the initiator self-approves alone, fully
  defeating the two-admin gate (the whole point of the ADR). The VM even carries `tenantAdminCount`
  but it's never threaded to the card. Check BOTH: (a) UI only offers self-approve when count===1;
  (b) the confirm use-case/repo re-verifies count===1 server-side on the `coSignerId===null` path
  (defense-in-depth — actions are directly callable). (US-E14.6, ADR 0037.)

**Why:** these slip past tsc/lint/tests (all green) but violate AC or design-system gates.
**How to apply:** run the AC-rule ↔ failure-path cross-check and a raw-color grep on every UI story
before reading for style.
